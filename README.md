Repository for: Nyberg &amp; Lundquist: “Distinct polygenic predictors of level and change explain superior memory in aging”.

# Contents
This repository contains the R-code for running the analyses from the N&L-paper. As we are unable to make the study data publically available, we illustrate using the well-known "Iris" dataset (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set ). For replication of the example analyses, the output obtained is available in html format.

# Required R packages
For the analyses in the paper: "shapr", "ggplot2", "shapviz", "ranger", "missRanger", "kernelshap".
For the example analysis, package "collapse" is also used.
